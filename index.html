            <div>
                <p>Myself Monojit Chand currently living in kolkata. I completed B.tech civil engineering. After that I was preparing for West Bengal Civil Service and West Bengal Police Service, I failed at the final stage for one marks but fail is fail. For west bengal police service I lose twelve kilo of my body weight, I used to study 8 to 12 hrs every day<br> But when result came out What I saw... I am fail. At the end of the day I know I gave my level best
                so I have no regret at all. Now at this situation I decided that I want to switch my career as a Full Stack developer because of I like design also I have somne knowledge.<br>
